			<p>When I came to Cebu to study English, I didn’t plan to travel to other islands at first, but I wanted to buy some textbooks in order to prepare for for IELTS. Since it is difficult to buy textbooks locally, I chose to order directly from the online platform. And my family will take the book for me from Taiwan and experience Cebu tourism by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Date : 2020.01.26</strong></p>
<h3 id="foreword">Foreword</h3>
<p>At this time, I had been in Cebu for about three months. I originally just wanted to stay here for holiday, but after being influenced by the whole overseas atmosphere, I decided to continue to improve my English skill, so I chose to study for IELTS. The teaching at the Cebu language school is actually to let you have an environment to better adapt to the exam or basic oral speaking, but in terms of exam strategy, I still believe that directly referring to experienced people can improve the exam grade, so I decided to buy books about how to improve IELTS grade. Originally, my family wanted me to go back to Taiwan to pick it up or send it to me by delivery. But I thought it was a good opportunity to let my parents know what a good environment here is, so I asked them to bring the book to me and I will guide them for traveling.😆</p>
<h3 id="itinerary-planning">Itinerary Planning</h3>
<p>Traveling to Cebu is actually very convenient. Whether it is a local travel agency or directly through a travel platform, you can purchase the itinerary directly. Usually, there will be a driver who will drive and guide the entire travel itinerary. It can be said that there is no need for planning at all, as long as you prepare money. This time, I was traveling with my family, it&rsquo;s enough as long as it was safe and convenient, I chose a one-day trip to Bohol Island directly. After taking a boat from the city of Cebu to the port and then to Bohol Island, it&rsquo;s a happy day trip itinerary experience.😎</p>
<h3 id="cebubohol">Cebu➝Bohol</h3>
<p>Because it is a one-day trip, the itinerary is quite urgent, and we must arrive at the place where we board the boat early in the morning. There will be a driver to pick you up to the boarding point in Cebu City (the driver make an appointment with us when we come back he will on the waiting place for waitting us ). The next step is to buy a ticket and board the Ocean Fast Ferries to tagbilaran port.</p>
<p>The shift at six o&rsquo;clock shows how early you need to get up and prepare

<p>It takes about two hours during sailing. After disembarking, we have to find the exclusive driver who has agreed to wait at the port, and let him lead us the rest of the itinerary.</p>
<h3 id="tarsier-conservation">Tarsier Conservation</h3>
<p>At that time, I didn&rsquo;t know much about this kind of monkey. I just heard that there is a very unique small tarsier on Bohol Island, so I was very much looking forward to seeing it. One of the itineraries when I came to Bohol Island was to come to the tarsier Conservation. I chatted with the driver on the way there. The driver said that it could be touched by people before, but because this kind of behavior made the tarsier very scared, it was so afraid that suicide due to insanity! So it&rsquo;s banned now and can only be viewed from a distance.</p>
<p>When I actually arrive at the conservation area, will be led into the park by a local guide, mainly to help find the tarsiers in the trees, because it is really small and the number is very rare, so it is really difficult to find. When I actually saw it, the body proportions really subverted my general imagination of monkeys, and tarsiers are nocturnal animals, so when you visit during the day, you will basically only see them sleeping. But what I photographed were those who opened their eyes but didn&rsquo;t move. I really don&rsquo;t know if they are awake or really sleeping.😂

</p>
<h3 id="chocolate-hill">Chocolate Hill</h3>
<p>After visiting the tarsiers, the next step is to go to the Chocolate Hills, which is one of the popular attractions in Bohol Island. During the rainy season, the Chocolate Hills are grassy green, and when summer comes, the hills will turn brown (chocolate color), so it is known as the Chocolate Hills. It&rsquo;s a pity that the time we went happened to be the transition period between the rainy season and summer, and the temperature was not very hot, so the vegetation on the hills had not yet turned brown. However, the actual view is still very magnificent.</p>
<p>You have to climb a certain hill to see multiple Chocolate Hills.😎

</p>
<h3 id="loboc-river">Loboc River</h3>
<p>I think this should be an itinerary added by the travel agency XD. The itinerary is basically to take a boat and have lunch to enjoy the tropical jungle scenery. Halfway through, you will get off the boat to experience the culture of the local people, which is a bit similar to the aboriginal culture in Taiwan. I think the good point is that the whole environment is full the Southeast Asian, and it feels like returning to the virgin forest.</p>
<p>The entertainment of the local children is to climb to the top of the tree and then jump into the river, I really want to try😆

</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The rest of the itinerary includes visiting local wild plants, zoos, and some churches and historic site. In fact, the whole itinerary is quite rich, but because I didn’t do my homework beforehand moreover it’s a totally different culture with mine, I don’t have any special ideas about some historic site. Basically, it’s just give a hurried and cursory glance. But just to see Tarsier, I think this trip is worth it. During the whole trip, the driver was also very enthusiastic to explain the relevant attractions to us, but the accent was a bit heavy. It’s a good thing I’ve been in Cebu for a while, so I can chat with him a little bit.
After the end, the driver will send us back to the place where we boarded the boat. After we arrived at the main island of Cebu, the sun just went down, and when we went back to the place where I agreed with the driver. The driver was already waiting for us. A fulfilling day trip is end.
