Introducing my favorite attraction, renowned for its spectacular volcanic landscape, geysers, hot springs, and the smell of sulfur - Noboribetsu Onsen Jigokudani.  
<!--more-->


### Foreword
It has been approximately 10 years since my last visit to Japan. Normally, when I have the opportunity to travel, I don't usually consider going to Japan because I feel it's too close to Taiwan, and I can always visit even when I'm older. Therefore, I always prefer to go to more distant places. However, for this family trip, considering everyone's time and preferences, we decided to embark on a self-driving journey in Hokkaido. Interestingly, my previous visit to Japan was also to Hokkaido.    

### Itinerary planning

This time, considering factors such as time constraints, car rental return fees, and personal preferences, we planned our itinerary starting from New Chitose Airport. After renting a car, we will head directly to Noboribetsu City (1 night) ‚ûû Hakodate City (1 night) ‚ûû and then return to New Chitose Airport to drop off the car before staying in Sapporo for two days and the end returning to Taiwan. I personally feel that the itinerary is quite tight. For those who enjoy leisurely exploration or visiting specific spots, it would be advisable to allocate more time. After all, most of the time on this trip will be spent driving, but our main purpose is to spend time with family and avoid exhausting the elderly with too much transportation. Additionally, we also want to enjoy the scenery along the way.  

### Arrival at New Chitose Airport ‚ûû Car rental

Upon arrival at the airport, you can follow the signage to locate the car rental area. Perhaps due to the pandemic or staff reduction, there were no personnel present at each counter, but instead, there were phones provided for contacting the responsible individuals.

We had made a prior reservation, expecting to pick up the car directly at the airport. However, we had to wait for 15 minutes for a representative from the car rental company to arrive at the airport and drive us to their rental office to get the car.

After collecting the car and completing a series of pre-check procedures, we were ready to hit the road. Our next destination was Noboribetsu City.

### Accommodation: Manseikaku Hotel, Noboribetsu.

Upon arrival, it was already evening, so we checked into the hotel first. After having dinner, we enjoyed a relaxing soak in the hot springs. Tomorrow, we would explore the area.

Regarding the attractions in Noboribetsu, since the Jigokudani (Hell Valley) has always been at the top of my list, I chose to stay near the Jigokudani itself. This area is essentially a resort, and our itinerary revolves around enjoying the hot springs, exploring the Jigokudani, and strolling through the Noboribetsu Onsen Shopping Street. It's also a great opportunity to buy some local souvenirs. It's the perfect plan!

### Enmado

On the way to the hot spring street, you can spot Enma-do Hall: a shrine or temple dedicated to Enma Daio, the Great King Enma. In Japanese Buddhism and Shinto beliefs, Enma Daio is regarded as the ruler and judge of Hell. He is believed to be responsible for determining people's karma, reincarnation, and overseeing the operation of Hell. Enma-do Hall represents people's faith and awe towards Hell, death, and karmic retribution, as well as their devout worship of Enma Daio. It seems that there are no such temples in Taiwan.üòÇ

Enma-do Hall features a special performance called "Noh Mask Changing" at specific times.

### Izumi Park 

On the way to Noboribetsu Jigokudani, you will pass through Izumi Park, located in the heart of the hot spring street. Although it is called a park, it is quite unique as it showcases the spectacle of hot water gushing out. It was built in 1996, costing approximately 80 million yen, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the opening of the hot springs. The park stands on the former site of the "Noboribetsu Paradise Hotel" and is also known as the birthplace of Noboribetsu Onsen.  

{{< figure src="pics/Sengen Park.webp" width="80%" alt="" title="">}}  
{{< figure src="pics/Sengen Park 1.webp" width="80%" alt="" title="">}}  

Inside the park, there is an intermittent geyser that, according to online sources, erupts approximately every 3 hours with hot springs reaching temperatures of about 80 degrees Celsius and reaching heights of up to 8 meters. The eruption lasts for about 50 minutes, during which around 2,000 liters of hot spring water gushes out. This unique experience can only be witnessed in Noboribetsu City. However, due to our tight schedule, we continued on our way to Jigokudani. Even without witnessing the eruption of hot springs, the sight of the intermittent geyser with its swirling white steam left a lasting impression.

### Yunokawa Shrine 

Nearby Izumi Park, you can spot the entrance to Yunokawa Shrine. However, we decided to forgo visiting it due to the need to climb several flights of stairs.üòÇ  

{{< figure src="pics/Yuzawa Shrine.webp" width="80%" alt="" title="Pass by Yunokawa Shrine.">}}  

Continuing on, we came across the entrance sign of Jigokudani, and I couldn't help but appreciate how cute the Japanese monsters and spirits depicted on the sign were.

### Noboribetsu Onsen Jigokudani 
Noboribetsu Jigokudani is a volcanic hot spring area renowned for its unique geothermal landscapes and gushing springs. The terrain and thermal activities here create a mysterious and fiery ambiance, fitting well with the imagery of hell.  

{{< figure src="pics/noboribetsu onsen jigokudani-3.webp" width="80%" alt="" title="Could see a sign indicating that we were getting closer and closer!">}}

{{< figure src="pics/noboribetsu onsen jigokudani-4.webp" width="80%" alt="" title="This sign must be joking!?">}}  

### Conclusion

In reality, exploring the entire Jigokudani could easily take half a day or more. If you venture deeper into the area, you will encounter attractions such as "Yunohana Hell," "Sanzu no Kawa," "Nanakamado Hiroba," and "Oyunuma." These spots are essentially within the hiking range of the entire Jigokudani area. However, due to our limited time and insufficient warm clothing, we decided not to linger outside for too long and made our way back.üòÇ  

First-time visitors to Hokkaido might not choose to come here, considering its distance from New Chitose Airport. Typically, for first-time visitors, it's common to explore famous attractions like Sapporo, Otaru, and Hakodate. However, I highly recommend the itinerary in Noboribetsu. In fact, this trip to Hokkaido was primarily planned to visit this area. If you have more time, it's recommended to stay for two nights, allocating one day for Jigokudani and the shopping street, while fully enjoying the natural hot springs here.
