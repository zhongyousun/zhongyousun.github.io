After December, the number of new students in language schools generally decreases, because most students need to go back to their hometown for New Yearâ€™s Eve, or come after the Lunar New Year. I am very happy to experience the local festive atmosphere during this time, but sometimes I still feel a little bit sad.ðŸ˜‚

### Foreword 
I came to Cebu in mid-November, and plan to stay in Cebu for half a year, so I will definitely experience Christmas and New Year in Cebu. In fact, my life has not changed much. I just stay on campus and continue to improve my English on weekdays and only left the campus on the weekend, mainly recording the atmosphere I felt in Cebu.

### Christmas
In Cebu, the atmosphere of Christmas is very different with Taiwan. In Taiwan, Christmas is a day that is hyped by businessmen and must prepare gifts and exchange with friends. Filipinos focus on reuniting with their families on this day. Basically, it is similar to our Lunar New Year, so people who are alone overseas at this time will feel inexplicably lonely, because friends have gone back to reunite with their families. 
However, although the purpose is different, the decorations that major shopping centers should have are also indispensable.

The interior decoration of Ayala malls is also quite atmospheric, which is very suitable for a walk and tryst.

I can feel it even when I order a delivery. This driver was the first person to say Merry Christmas to me.ðŸ˜Ž

When exchanging currency, some people even wear Christmas hats directly.ðŸ˜†

### New Yearâ€™s Eve
After Christmas, the next are New Year's Eve and Lunar New Year. In Cebu New Year's Eve, there are fireworks activities like other areas. This year, the location where the fireworks are set off is located in Ayala malls. I went to dinner with my friends that night. There are some restaurant hsa no seats, next time we must make a reservation in advance.

After that, we found a restaurant temporarily, and went in to eat when there was a seat. After the dinner, my friend suggested to drink some wine.  
So we chose a French wine bar:La Vie Parisienne.    
This store has beautifully decorated, suitable for taking pictures or dating couples, but I didnâ€™t take any pictures at that momentðŸ˜†

After the dinner, because I still have a curfew, and I didn't want to spend the night outside, so I had to go back to the dormitory. There were actually some activities in the campus at that time, and most of the students gathered in the social area to chat. But I still wanted to focus on my studies and try to keep my schedule as normal as possible, I planned to stay in the dormitory and study until 12 o'clock before going to bed.

Watching the New Year's Eve fireworks alone in the dormitory is really a bit sentimental XD. 
### Conclusion  
It was the first time to experience Christmas, New Year's Eve and Lunar New Year in a foreign country. Because of the local security and school curfew, I didn't have a deep experience of the local people's way of celebrating the festival. However, I still experienced the joy of celebrating with friends of different nationalities. Although I had to return to the dormitory on time in the end, it was a very different Christmas and New Year's Eve.
