### Foreword   
I really didn't experience various travel itineraries as much as possible when I studied in Cebu because of various factors such as financial and self-expectation. However I don’t regret it, because no matter what I choose, it is also an experience.😎  

### Entertainment
Cebu is the second largest city in the Philippines, so there are actually quite a variety of activities that can be experienced. Even there are some activities that it is my first time to heard.😂 Students can also participate a travel group by the school or directly find a local travel agency. It's quite convenient. There are quite a lot of one-day tour groups in Cebu, and you can hire a tour guide to take you directly for a whole day. 

Because of my limited funds and a week of courses from morning to night, I always take the simple route or sometimes just wants to take a rest and at most go out for a meal and a drink.  
 
Full day of classes will really make you so tired that you will run back to the dormitory to sleep when you are free.

### First time to cinema in cebu
This entertainment is that I always did in Taiwan and I often go to the movies by myself. Of course I must try it abroad. The audio-visual equipment in Cebu is not as good as in Taiwan and  not subtitles on movie, so I need to train my listening first. Movie theaters in different malls will also have differences between old and new. It is quite a popular entertainment option for Filipinos!  
There are so many people in the cinema here, it's same as Taiwan.

I think Robinsons Galleria Cebu cinema is newer than other.

Watching a movie with my Filipino friends, it was the first time I saw someone who could eat fried chicken with a knife and fork very fluently. 🤣

Commemorate the first movie (Jumanji) I saw in the Philippines, the tickets are super cheap. If my listening is better, I will really see a movie more. XD

What is very cultural shock is that watching movies in Taiwan basically does not make loud voices except for children. But in the Philippines, no matter how elder or younger, there will be all kinds of voice. My Filipino friends beside me also laughed at every funny scenes, It can be seen that the Filipinos have unrestrained souls from the heart.   
The whole movie theater is very lively, I really curious to know what situation when watching a ghost movie.😂  

###  Restaurants
When you come to Cebu, you must try Filipino cuisine. The restaurants like Choobi choobi are so delicious. As for the cuisines of various countries, the Korean ethnic group accounts for a large proportion in Cebu, so you can see Korean barbecue restaurants everywhere. I already loved Korean cuisine before. After coming here, I realized that the Korean restaurants in Taiwan are a bit more Taiwanese-style. But the Korean-style barbecue in the Philippines is really authentic. The reason may be that basically most of the store owners are Koreans here!!   

My most recommended Korean BBQ restaurant 👍, the name of the restaurant at that time was Su lat gan, for some reason it only has Korean name now.

If you really don't know which restaurant is authentic, the best way is to ask Korean students directly.  
I don't know why Koreans are so hyped.

I also learned a lot of interesting ways of drinking.😎

**In short, what kind of restaurant is authentic, the fastest way to know is ask the students in that country.**

As for Taiwan, there are quite a lot, because I only prefer Taiwan hot pot and wanted to concentrate on my studies, I tried to reduse go out that could be avoided as much as possible. But I still come here to miss the taste of my hometown.
There is nothing to say about the taste, it is exactly the same as the small hot pot restaurant near my home.😱

Restaurant name:Red House Taiwan Sha-bu Sha-bu

You can also order this kind of thing that doesn't seem to appear in hot pot restaurants in Taiwan.😂

### IT Park
IT Park seems to be the commercial center of Cebu, and there are many job opportunities here. But I heard from the locals that most of them are customer service jobs. Customers are from other countries, so working hours are usually at night or in shifts. There are many bars and KTVs in here, the more night get more beauty!?  
But I have curfew, I don't really want to spend the night outside, so I go back to school early.😂

### Sugbo Mercado night market
You can experience the Sugbo Mercado Night Market near IT Park.

It is similar to night markets in Taiwan, of course the food is different. I think the overall environment is very clean.  
{{< figure src="pics/IMG_0542.jpeg" width=80%" >}}  

While eating, there were also people singing and performing on the front stage, but they all spoke Cebuano, I couldn’t understand it. What is very different is that Filipinos are so excited that they will actually go up and sing after being invited.😎
