Alvin, currently a software engineer responsible for backend system development.  

Hope that one day in the future, I can achieve the state where work is solely for a sense of accomplishment rather than just for survival.

This site mainly shares life experiences, travel tips, and a bit of technical notes.  

If you have any questions, same interests, or want to exchange technical information, please feel free to contact me.
