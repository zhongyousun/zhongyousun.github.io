The record accidentally entered a local residential area (Cabantan Street) that is usually not dared to enter.
<!--more-->
**Date : 2020.01.24**   

### Foreword
The traffic in downtown Cebu is usually the most congested on Fridays, because the locals always go out to eat and drink after a hard work week, and I chose to take Angkas in order to catch up with the dinner. Because the driver chose to take the side road instead of the main road in order to reduce the chance of traffic jam, I accidentally entered the local residential area (Cabantan Street) that I usually dare not enter.ðŸ˜†  

### Cabantan Street Location

Cabantan Street is located in the Luz district. You can see that the Luz district is next to Ayala Malls, so I usually take the Cardinal Rosales Ave from the Mabolo district where the school locate to Ayala Malls. I usually notice the street of Cabantan Street when passing by. I think it is a very stylish street, but because of safety considerations, I have never entered it.


### Go to an all-you-can-eat seafood restaurant (Isla Sugbo Seafood City)
I had appointment with my friends at Isla Sugbo Seafood City that night, mainly because I havenâ€™t tried all-you-can-eat restaurants outside of Taiwan, and particularly restaurants mainly serve seafood. I really wanted to experience the quality of the restaurant. Overall, the dining environment is perfect. All kinds of seafood are directly selected on the spot and then the cooking method is selected by yourself. In fact, I just started to catch up on all the English vocabulary related to cooking. ðŸ˜†The only downside is that it takes a long time to serve the food, probably because there are too many customers. At present, it seems that it is permanently closed due to the epidemic situation, so I will not continue to introduce it in detail.

Because the location of this store is just at the exit above Cabantan Street, if you take Grab, the approximate route is to go around the main roads like Mindanao Ave or Pope John Paul II Ave on both sides, because it happened to be in a hurry that day, I chose to take Angkas, the driver took me directly to the Cabantan Street path.

In Cebu, if the location is not far away, I often choose go out by walk, because of safety considerations, I basically take avenue, and I dare not go directly to the alleys. After all, it is quite conspicuous for Chinese to walk on the streets of Cebu.

This time, because I was in a hurry, I accidentally entered this small street that I think has a very Southeast Asian atmosphere, and particularly at night. ðŸ˜Ž  
It's a pity that I didn't have the opportunity to actually walk around, it was really full of people.

### Conclusion
Although it was just passing by in a hurry, the cultural buildings in the local residential area are really special, and you must actually go by walk if you have the opportunity.ðŸ˜†
