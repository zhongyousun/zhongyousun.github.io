Experienced the long-awaited Cebu common transportation Jeepney and the largest and newest theme park in Cebu : **Anjo World Theme Park**.
<!--more-->
**Date : 2020.01.11**   

### Foreword 
There are basically two transportation options for foreigners in Cebu are taxis (Grab) and motorcycles (Angkas), or you can just walking like me. But what you can see the most common on the road is the jeepney (bus), which is also the most common means of transportation for locals. I have always wanted to try it, but seeing that the bus is always full of Filipinos, and they can stop at any time, without a bus stop sign, I donâ€™t even know the entire driving line, and I am afraid that I will be taken to the wilderness I can't go back to my home, so I still dare not experience alone. ðŸ˜‚   

Fortunately, I beg my local friends to take me for a ride and she promised me, so we took the jeepney for the whole journey, including transfers with Anjo World Theme Park, the largest and newest theme park in Cebu, as my destination. (When I was writing this article, I searched for information by the way, and found that the route can now be queried through google map!!)

### Get on the jeepney at the departure point
I live in the Mabolo area, which is some distance away from Anjo World Theme Park. You can see that I need to transfer other jeepney and then can arrive at the destination.

My personality is when I go to a place, if someone already familiar this place, I will not deliberately find the way. So the whole trip, I was in a coma, anyway, I just believed in my friends. ðŸ˜ŽThe starting location is tejero (villa gonzalo). When I came here, I realized that I had to wait for the driver to start the car. Because there was no one before the car started, we sat directly in the passenger seat. At first, I wondered why I came here to wait for the bus. It's easy to get on the jeepney through waving on the road, maybe  the reason is if you are at the departure point, you can easily find a seat.  

The appearance and interior environment of each jeepney are actually very different. It depends entirely on driving preferences. This one is a bit old, but there are still many jeepneys that look good. A bit similar to the concept of refitted vehicle in Taiwan?

I just thought it was quite cool to sit in the passenger front seat in a jeepney for the first time, so I took a picture.

Then we hit the road. The signboard in front is the driving route, but for foreigners who are completely unfamiliar with the local area, it can be said that they have no idea where to go.

### Transfer to other jeepneys on the way
Because of the route, We need to get off and take another jeepney. This time there is no place for the passenger front seat.

In fact, the rear compartment is really crowded, and Filipinos are generally not tall, so the height of the compartment is quite low. I really took the ride with my head down all the wayðŸ˜†, and it was cool to watch the traffic behind while sitting. If there were more people, some people would even hang from the upper pole directly by hand, which is actually quite dangerous. On the way, I also met some Filipinos who were high school students who take rides and did not pay. Teenager in all the world are really same.ðŸ˜Ž

### Arrive at Anjo World Theme Park
After a lot of hard work, I finally arrived at Anjo World Theme Park (in fact, I just followed my friends ðŸ˜Ž)

The type of ticket we bought is Super Tres (Limited to Three Rides), which is cheaper but can only choose three rides, and the ticket price is Php 250. This kind of ticket price may be to attract groups with lower salaries or students. After entering the venue, you can clearly see the guidance of the amusement facilities, unlike Taiwan's amusement parks, which are really big enough to get lost.

Because we only have three facilities to take, so we are not in a hurry, anyway, just walk around and eat something in the park. Like other amusement parks, many buildings are suitable for taking pictures.

In the end, we chose to take the free fall, carousel and Ferris wheel. The atmosphere in the amusement park at night was better than in the morning, and there were more people.

### Conclusion
It is actually very difficult to experience this kind of itinerary when you just be in Cebu to travel. After all, you will worry about traffic safety on the road, or prefer save time and go directly to the chartered driving route. I am very grateful that someone can lead this journey, and go deeper into the transportation methods and life of the local people. Experienced memories that are hard to experience.
