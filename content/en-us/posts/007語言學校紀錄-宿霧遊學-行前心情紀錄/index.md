### Foreword
Recently, I looked back at the photos and found that there was no record left.  
After all, I signed up for the famous Spartan course at that time, I knew that what awaited me was cram school hell,  
In addition, the agency also mentioned factors such as public security, air pollution and really tiring courses in the Philippines.
At that time, I felt depressed to the journey of Cebu.

### Prepare in Taoyuan Airport
In order to get cheap air tickets, I will sleep at the airport the day before and take a flight that departs early in the morning.


### Arrive at Mactan-Cebu International Airport

My flight landed at the second terminal, and the first impression I felt about envirement was actually quite good, although the second terminal is small but quite new and very modern in appearance,  
Check the info that I knew the second terminal was opened on July 1, 2018.   
It obvious that it is newly built haha.  
The next step is to go through the customs and pick up the luggage.   
Because there is a certificate of language school attached visa,  
The customs didn't ask anything at all (maybe they also know that my English is not good and I just want to learn English) and let me go.  

### Mactan-Cebu International Airport ‚ûù Language School 
After leaving the airport, I have to find driver of language school who is responsible for picking up the students, usually holding a sign with the name of the language school you belong to.
After successfully finding him, I got into his car and went straight to the language school.

The journey to the language school actually takes about 20-30 minutes,   
because Mactan Airport is actually located in Lapu-Lapu City.   
The position of the plane as shown in the picture below is actually located on the right side of the entire Cebu Island.

Language school is in the main island of Cebu

On the bridge to the main island of Cebu.

I really didn‚Äôt leave any photos on the way, I only had one thought in mind,  
**Oh my god, why did the city look quite old after leaving the airport?üòÇ**  


### Arrive at Language School
It was Sunday when I arrived, so there were not many students in the school,  
In fact, the school environment is not bad, there is a swimming pool, and many outdoor social places  
There is quite a vacation atmosphere, and it was only later that I realized that many people came here to learn English while at vacation.

The next step is to register.  
The school guards showed me around and get to know the campus. The guards are Filipinos.
They are quite amiable.  
I really don't know what he's talking about XD, because of my poor listening at that time and unfamiliar with the Filipino accent.

After the visit, I can go to my dormitory.

Three people share a room, which is not bad for someone like me who has just finished compulsory military service.üòé

Fortunately, The roommates I met were very nice. I still remember when I first time entering the room.  
I just met my Korean roommate who was taking rest. After that, I could only squeeze vocabulary and grammar out of my head as much as possible.  
Both of us are not good at English, but environment forced us to communicate with each other, it is really amazing that we can unexpectedly understand each other.  

That night, I swear that I really spoke more English in one day than I have spoken in Taiwan for more than 20 years...  
Of course, the following courses will let me speak more English then that night.  

Look at this full schedule, It's tired than high school students.

The street view near the language school is attached, it seems that it was raised by the neighbors nearby.

I grow up in Taiwan, really think it's so cool.
