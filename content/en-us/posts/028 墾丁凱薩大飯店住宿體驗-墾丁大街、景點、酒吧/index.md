A Relaxing Journey to Kenting Street, Famous Attractions, and Bars - My Experience and Thoughts on a Luxurious Accommodation.  
<!--more-->


### Foreword
This past long weekend, I was dragged by my girlfriend to travel with her large family to Kenting. The main purpose was to celebrate the first visit of elder brother and his wife Sophie from Australia to Taiwan and to let them experience the famous vacation destination in southern Taiwan. Unfortunately, I was suffering from stomach flu throughout the entire trip, and I was very cautious about everything. I didn't take many photos of the scenery, didn't eat much of the local street food, and only had a sip or two of alcohol. However, Kenting is still a novelty for me, as a person from southern Taiwan, since it's relatively close geographically, and I had been too lazy to visit before, resulting in no memory of having been there ðŸ˜‚. So, I am recording my first Kenting vacation experience.  

### Caesar Park Kenting
After having lunch, we drove directly to [Caesar Park Kenting](https://kenting.caesarpark.com.tw/  "Caesar Park Kenting"),The room type was booked by my girlfriend's father and it was a Deluxe Guest Room, featuring exotic Balinese-style decor with lush foliage and a romantic atmosphere.

What's cool is that the room's perimeter can directly connect to the outdoor Coconut Grove Pool.

Just exploring the entire Caesar Hotel would keep you entertained for a long time, you wouldn't even need any other schedules. ðŸ¤£    

### Kenting Street - Dinner

Basically, for those who come to Kenting, dinner is usually taken care of on this street.

### Little Bay Bar
After finishing dinner, we came to this stall. I was actually quite tired at this point, so I just took some casual photos. The scenery and atmosphere were really nice though, and you can come here to relax both during the day and at night.

When We arrived around ten o'clock, there were still a lot of people, so I noticed some of them just sat directly on the beach. I was kind of tempted to try drinking until I got drunk and sleeping until tomorrow right there on the beach, but my stomach really wouldn't allow it.ðŸ¥´

The bar was open until eleven o'clock, I was very tired when I got back, so I just washed up and went straight to bed.   
As I was staying in such a top hotel, I thought that I shouldn't stay out too late, especially since I hadn't even had the chance to go in the hot spring yet.    

### Hotel buffet breakfast 

In the morning, I had the hotel's buffet breakfast, which was of the same quality as the top hotels in Taiwan, so I didn't take any photos. The dining environment was spacious, so it didn't feel crowded, but I'm not sure if it was because I woke up too late.ðŸ˜… Next, I go in the hot spring, and checked out at exactly 11:00am.

### Gelato Day by Day

As my brother had to rush back to Taipei, our afternoon schedule was kept simple. We chose to visit the Daylily Ice Shop to take some photos and enjoy some refreshing ice desserts before heading directly to the high-speed rail station.

### Conclusion

It's been a long time since I last visited Kenting, or maybe I've never been here before, I'm not sure.ðŸ˜Ž
Just in case I forget again, I'll jot it down. I experienced the top-tier hotel, the beach, hot springs, and scenic views. If you choose Caesar Park Hotel, your itinerary should be able to be slightly more relaxed, after all, the hotel facilities need to be used well. Coming to the southernmost point of Taiwan, unlike living in the city, one must experience the slow pace. Next time, I must sit on the beach and have a drink.
