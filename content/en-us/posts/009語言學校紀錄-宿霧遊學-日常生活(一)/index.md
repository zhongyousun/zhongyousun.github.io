### Foreword    
It has been a week since I came to Cebu. I lived in Sparta campus, so the school only permitted students to go out on the weekend. Sparta campus has strict curfew, minors who want to stay outside overnight must get confirmation from their parents before and they will be allowed. Before I came to Cebu, I had already heard about it from the agency, At that time, I thought the Philippines was quite dangerous as well , so I didn‚Äôt have any plans to go out of school.
### First time to go around outside

Thinking back at that time, I was still a little afraid of going out of school, Moreover, I was a person who prefer stay at home. Fortunately, I met a good roommate who is a Korean, about 30 years old, who went on working holiday in Australia before. Because his goal is immigration, he came to Cebu with his girlfriend to study English. He came about a week earlier than me, and when I asked him about the environment outside the school, he graciously invited me to go out for a stroll.  

### Taiwan bubble milk tea
This is my first spot in Cebu. Formosa Taiwan Milk Tea Shop

Because my roommate was focus on study so that didn't go out very often, so this time we just took a walk within a walking distance. In fact, if we are same nationality, we had nothing to discuss about the name of this store. It really took me a long time to explain to this Korean couple what is relationship between Formosa and Taiwan.üòÇ The feeling of the whole store is a bit similar to the internet-famous shop in Taiwan. The decoration is gorgeous. As for the taste,the overall has not yet reached my standard.
No matter what beverage shop in Taiwan, I always order bubble milk tea, it make me to be called the king of milk tea, I full the confidence of this.üòé    
However, if you drink a beverage with the shop name is about Taiwan on abroad, even if it is a fake, I will give it 100 score.üòÜ

### Massage
The next step is to experience massage that you must experience when you come to Cebu. In fact, there are many massage massage shop in the whole urban area, and even a large shopping mall has an area that directly provides massage...
{{< figure src="pics/IMG_0325.jpeg" width="80%" >}} 

I had never been to a massage shop in Taiwan, after all, the consumption is really not cheap for me. But after seeing this price, I often came to here by myself when I felt tired. (just search casually on Google Maps, go in and try it outüòÇ) You can basically see Chinese, Korean and Japanese menus in Cebu, because the salary of the locals is very low, Most of the entertainment is provided to foreigners, and even KTV has Japanese, Korean and Chinese songs.  

This is the itinerary of going out for the first time above. I am very grateful to my roommate for giving me this opportunity, which makes me always want to go outside later.üòé   

### School life
The environment in the language school is really rich, there is a swimming pool, a canteen, a sales department, a laundry department. In addition to the self-study room, there are also a lot of places suitable for sitting and chatting on campus. After all, language schools need an environment for students from different countries to practice speaking.  

You can eat and read at the outdoor table, accompanied by cat~

If the school food is too unpalatable, many students decide to order delivery directly.  
Jollibee, which is only available in the Philippines, I think is delicious and cheap, basically every set meal you can a pack of rice.üòÇ
{{< figure src="pics/IMG_0365.jpeg" width="80%" >}}  

Basically, the school has provided all the necessities of life, and every week there will be a cleaner to help change the sheets and clean the dormitories.  

It's really possible to do **not leave school at all**.

Because we always ask her to clean our dormitory at the same time every week, and we become very familiar in the end.üòé

### Purchasing of necessary items
Basically, at the beginning of the school, new students will be guide to Ayala Mall to exchange currency or buy some daily necessities. The days after you have to rely on yourself~!

At first, I didn't like going to Ayala Mall because it was so big that I often got lost.  
Please ignore the map. I gave up knowing the way. Anyway, after walking for a long time, I will know how to get there.üòé   
{{< figure src="pics/IMG_0395.jpeg" width="50%" >}}   

When I got familiar with Ayala Mall, I often come here to eat dessert and drink afternoon tea~
{{< figure src="pics/IMG_1727.jpeg" width="80%" >}} 

Here I want to explain that there are guards at the entrances of various shopping malls in Cebu, and even individual stores in shopping malls. But usually it‚Äôs just doing things like opening the door for you. I really curious if the reason is that the public safety is really bad, or just the labor wages are too cheap.
It is also very common to find that there are 3 or 4 employees in a storefront that is clearly empty, which is simply impossible in Taiwan.   

Apart from Ayala Mall, there are actually quite a few shopping centers in downtown Cebu. If I usually just buy some snacks, I prefer a small mall that is closer to the school. (Because I usually walk directly from campus to Ayala Mall, I just like the feeling of walking on the street abroad XD) In some small shopping malls, the counter staff will take the initiative to pack the purchased things for you. I have never been treated like this in TaiwanüòÜ

### Cut hair
Most of the students I meet at the language school attend short-term course, most of which are two-three weeks or two months at most. But I signed up for the six-month course üòÇ because of the agency‚Äôs advice. Basically, it was difficult to find someone stay longer than me at the end hahaha. Also because I have to stay here for a long time, I have to cut my hair here.   

There are quite a variety of barber shops in Cebu, because there are generally more Koreans, there are really quite a lot of Korean hairsty barber. I really don't dare to try the local ones because the price are too cheap, moreover I prefer Korean hairstyles, so I always look for Korean stores.  

This is my favorite barber shop. The owner is a Korean middle-aged woman, and other staffs who wash hair are all Filipinos. I think her skill is excellent. I had an experience that there is a Filipino asks me if I was Korean when I was walking on the road.ü§®   
**The point is the price is only NT$200!!!**

I have tried other barber shops that are more expensive and have full the decoration, but the skill is poor. One time after being cut to bad sitution, I went back and asked my Korean roommate what was going on, and he only told me that maybe hair barber might be not care. Because this kind of barber specially cut international students who only come once. After all, there are really many short-term students will choose them because don't know this barber bad repution.
